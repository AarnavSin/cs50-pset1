# CS50 Week 1 Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CS50 Week 1 Problem Set exercises. These exercises are part of the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course offered by Harvard University.

## Problem Set Exercises

1. **Hello**
   - Description: A simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
   - File: `hello.c`

2. **Mario (More)**

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired problem's directory.
3. Compile the C program using a C compiler, for example:
   ```
   gcc -o hello hello.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./hello
   ```
   Make sure to replace `hello` with the respective compiled filename for each problem.
